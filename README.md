## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I have solidified my foundations in JavaScript by using a wide variety of methods and properties that I hadn't previously employed. I believe I achieved complex functionality by displaying content from different pages without the use of routes. By encapsulating many features in this project, I feel proud to see that the logic functions correctly.

### Continued development

I want to focus in the near future on working more efficiently and effectively. To achieve that, I want to learn frameworks like React.js. Additionally, I would like to find tools that facilitate the implementation of styling on the page.

### Useful resources

- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io)-This is an easy-to-use tool that helped me enhance the page's presence by using simple and visually pleasing icons.
